<h1>Austin's Notes</h1>
<br>
<b>Important Information</b>
<br>
<p>The World Wide Web:
</p>
<p>The world wide web is made up of HTML files. These files are what makes the World Wide Web,
"web-like."
  The Major pieces of the internet are, you(your computer), the internet and servers.
  HTTP is used to communicate between your computer and the web server.
</p>
<p>HTML is made up of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text Content(what you see)</li>
  <li>Markup(what it looks like)</li>
  <li>References to other Documents(for example: images or videos)</li>
  <li>Links to other Pages</li>
</ul>
<br><b>Tags:</b>
<ul>
  <li>HTML also uses tags. Tags are used so the computer can understand what you want it to do, or so you can tell the computer what you want something to look like.</li>
  <li>For example:&lt;br&gt; Is a break tag.</li>
  <li>In between those tags is the content.</li>
  <li>The Tag and the Content together, make your element.</li></ul>

<br><b>Imprtant things to remember:</b>
<ul>
  <li>When writing code, you need to be very precise with your imputs, because if your aren't, the computer will not understand what you are trying to tell it. In a sense, computers are "stupid."</li>
  <li>You can't remember everything, so don't feel bad about having to look things up on Google(or whatever search engine is your preference).</li>
  <li>There are also two different kinds of elements, block and inline.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Block organizes text into blocks and inline, well.....doesn't.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
